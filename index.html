            <div>On August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019, amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov was looking through his home-built 0.65-meter telescope in Nauchnny, Crimea.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>He noticed an unusual object. It had a coma - a comet!</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>When he searched the JPL's database for any comets in the area, nothing came up. This was new!</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>A new comet. And one that, based on his calculations, risked hitting Earth!</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>He immediately submitted his results to the IAU Minor Planet Center's NEO (Near-Earth Object) Confirmation Page.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>NASA soon determined that the object is most likely in a safe, but hyperbolic orbit - meaning that it is a wayfarer "passing through" the solar system.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>It is only the second such object discovered in human history, and the first discovered by an amateur.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>The comet, nicknamed the Christmas Comet, reached its closest point to Earth on the 7<sup>th</sup> of December, 2019.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>This is probably the closest it will ever come to Earth.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>The time-lapse video in this background was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope during October 2019. It is the highest resolution image of the comet to date.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>Currently, the technology for intercepting the comet does not exist. It is traveling much too fast for any spacecraft to realistically be capable of rendezvousing with it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div>Someday it may become feasible to intercept this cosmic wayfarer. Until then, enjoy the video!</div>
